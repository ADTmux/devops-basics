# Why groovy?
- Groovy is being used for developing the Jenkins pipeline, so it better if we have the knowledge about this language

# Install groovy
- See https://groovy-lang.org/install.html (I prefer using SDK man)
- Facing missing java issue while installing: Visit: [groovy-with-sdk-missing-java.md](.././../troubleshooting/installation/groovy-with-sdk-missing-java.md)

# Basic groovy scripting
- See [helloworld](./helloworld/)
