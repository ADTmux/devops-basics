# What is Docker?

Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. [Learn more](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

# Why Docker?

Docker's significance lies in its capability to streamline application development, deployment, and execution through containerization technology.

# How does Docker work?

Docker functions by utilizing containerization to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistent operation across different environments.

# Why Docker in DevOps?

Docker has become integral to DevOps methodologies due to its ability to create consistent environments, streamline development-to-production workflows, facilitate version control, and enable efficient scaling and deployment. Its lightweight, portable containers allow for easy orchestration, resource optimization, and increased agility in the development lifecycle.
