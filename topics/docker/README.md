# What is Docker?

- Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. It allows for packaging applications and their dependencies into containers.

# Why Docker?

- Docker's significance lies in its ability to streamline the development and deployment processes, enabling consistency across different environments and facilitating efficient resource utilization.

# How does Docker work?

## Overview

- Docker uses containerization technology to create isolated environments, called containers, that encapsulate applications and their dependencies. This ensures consistency and portability across various systems.

## Docker Architecture

- For a deeper understanding, refer to the [Docker Architecture documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-architecture).

# Why Docker in DevOps?

- Docker plays a crucial role in DevOps by enabling the creation of reproducible environments, facilitating continuous integration and deployment, and improving collaboration between development and operations teams.

# Prerequisites

- Familiarity with containerization concepts and basic Linux command-line usage would be beneficial for understanding Docker.

# Installation

## How to install Docker?

- Follow the steps outlined in the [Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for both local development and production environments.
